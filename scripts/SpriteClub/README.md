## SpriteClub Autobet
This one is rather weird as you may be able to tell from the sheer size from it.

### Les Parts
- #### Actual script
Without the server running the script just randomly bets on either red or blue with a random amount. With the server running it asks the server to evaluate the fight beforehand and bets based on the predicted winner with an amount based on the certainty.
**It also draws a pretty cool graph** 
- #### Server
Acts like an unofficial SpriteClub API with a limited amount of endpoints. It can return information about characters and compare them with a somewhat decent accuracy.
