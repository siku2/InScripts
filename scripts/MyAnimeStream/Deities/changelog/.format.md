<type><[<priority>] (optional)>: <text handling (YAML)> <text>;

added: A changelog parser to parse this file;
CHANGED[2]: >
            The type will be capitalised internally
            and your text can span over multiple lines!
            It will even get dedented;
DEPRECATED: |
If you want to have your text all over the place (I mean, why not?)
            you can use the pipe character;

	security: Feel free to indent your things btw, doesn't really matter;

// Comments are also a thing
Actually, everything is a comment as long as it doesn't match the above format so knock yourself out
   mind_you_comma_if: you write like this, it will be detected if you don't add the //;
//quack: this won't break a thing;
