# MyAnimeStream
A powerful extension for MyAnimeList which turns the site into a streaming site! Using various (more or less legal) methods this script fetches and embeds a stream for your favourite shows.

> This script also contains the functionality of **MAL+**

## Install
##### [Version 0.8.2](https://github.com/siku2/InScripts/raw/master/scripts/MAL%2B/MyAnimeStream/Deities/myanimestream.user.js)


# MAL+

Removes ads from MyAnimeList and provides a nice little "Find on 9Anime" button which searches for the anime so you can watch it even faster.

## Install

#### Latest: [Version 1.3](https://cdn.rawgit.com/siku2/InScripts/cdea1292/scripts/MAL%2B/MALplus.user.js)
[Version 1.2](https://cdn.rawgit.com/siku2/InScripts/1a339cfb/scripts/MAL%2B/MALplus.user.js)
