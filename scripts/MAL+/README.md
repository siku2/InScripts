# MAL+

Removes ads from MyAnimeList and provides a nice little "Find on 9Anime" button which searches for the anime so you can watch it even faster.

## Install

#### Latest: [Version 1.3](https://cdn.rawgit.com/siku2/InScripts/cdea1292/scripts/MAL%2B/MALplus.user.js)
[Version 1.2](https://cdn.rawgit.com/siku2/InScripts/1a339cfb/scripts/MAL%2B/MALplus.user.js)

### Styles

In the future I might try to pump up MAL's CSS a little bit. Right now you can already use the `Arrow` theme for your anime list. Which looks something like this:
